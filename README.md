# DUEL-AXIS-SOLAR-TRACKER
Introducing the Dual-Axis Solar Tracker IoT Project

Our Dual-Axis Solar Tracker IoT project is an innovative and energy-efficient solution that harnesses the power of technology to optimize solar energy generation. By intelligently tracking the sun's movement throughout the day, this project ensures maximum exposure to sunlight and efficient charging of solar panels. Here's a brief overview of the project:

Project Features:

1. Dual-Axis Tracking: Our solar tracker is equipped with both horizontal and vertical movement capabilities. This dual-axis functionality allows it to follow the sun's path across the sky from sunrise to sunset.

2. Smart Light Sensing: The project incorporates four light sensors strategically positioned to accurately detect the intensity of sunlight. These sensors provide real-time data that guides the solar tracker's movement.

3. Precise Servo Motors: Two servo motors are employed to control the movement of the solar panel. By precisely adjusting the panel's orientation, the system ensures optimal solar exposure.

4. Ardunio Control: The heart of the system is an Arduino board, which processes data from the light sensors and calculates the necessary adjustments for the servo motors. The Arduino's programming logic drives the entire solar tracking mechanism.

5. Solar Panel Charging: The solar panel's orientation is dynamically adjusted to maximize sunlight absorption. This results in improved energy generation and charging efficiency throughout the day.

6. Energy Efficiency: By keeping the solar panel aligned with the sun's position, energy production is optimized. This makes the system highly efficient and increases the overall power output.

6.Various Connectors and Wiring                                                  

Implementation:

The project's code, along with detailed instructions on connecting the components, can be found on our GitHub repository.
This code is written in C++ and is designed to provide the solar tracker's functionality by processing sensor data and controlling the servo motors.
The light sensors continuously monitor the sunlight intensity, and the Arduino calculates the optimal position for the solar panel based on this data.
The servo motors receive commands from the Arduino to adjust the panel's orientation accordingly.
Note of Caution:

It's important to exercise caution and follow safety guidelines when working with electronic components, particularly when dealing with power sources like solar panels. Ensure proper insulation, wiring, and grounding to prevent accidents or damage.
